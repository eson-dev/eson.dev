I have officially joined [Haven Studios](https://www.havenstudios.com/) in November 2021 as a senior online software engineer.

Haven was founded in March 2021 as an independent studio working on an unannounced new IP for PlayStation. You can read about [the announcement on PlayStation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/16/introducing-haven-a-new-montreal-based-independent-studio/).

For obvious reasons, I will not be able to share what I'm currently working on here. :zipper_mouth_face: Stay tuned for official announcements.

To know more about the studio, you can watch the Fireside Chat our CEO Jade Raymond had with GamesIndustry.biz in October 2021:
