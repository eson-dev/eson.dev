I am a software developer with more than 10 years of professional experience.

In 2007, I started my career developing business applications using ASP.NET. With a strong interest in video games, I completed a part-time specialist diploma in games development. In 2011, I brought my expertise in enterprise software and began my journey in the video game industry, building tools and services to support the ever growing needs of Games as a service (GaaS).

I am currently based in Montreal and work at Ubisoft as a senior online programmer.
